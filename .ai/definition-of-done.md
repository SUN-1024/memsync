# Definition of Done

repomemo is a Bash script plus a markdown scaffold. "Done" is therefore
defined in terms of script correctness, scaffold completeness, and
documentation consistency.

## Required commands

Run from the repository root. All commands must succeed before a change is
considered done.

- **Smoke test the CLI**: `bash bin/repomemo --version` and `bash bin/repomemo --help`.
- **Run the integration test suite**: `bash tests/test_repomemo.sh`.
- **Self-check**: `bash bin/repomemo check .` (repomemo's own `.ai/` must pass).

There is no compiler, linter, formatter, or typechecker configured for this
repository. Any change to that decision should be documented here in the
same commit.

## A change is "done" when

1. **Every required command above passes locally.**
2. **All seven `.ai/` files exist and are non-empty.**
3. **The two root adapters stay in sync.**
   - `CLAUDE.md` lists every `.ai/` file via `@./path` imports in the read
     order defined by `.ai/README.md`.
   - `AGENTS.md` lists the same files in the same order, plus the post-task
     update rule.
4. **The two root READMEs stay mirrored.**
   - `README.md` (English) and `README.zh.md` (Simplified Chinese) cover the
     same ground; whichever was edited, the other is updated in the same
     change.
5. **`templates/` files match `.ai/` semantics.** When the scaffold gains or
   loses a file, both `templates/` and the file lists in
   `bin/repomemo` (`SCAFFOLD_FILES`), `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` are
   updated together.
6. **`bin/repomemo` is executable** (`chmod +x`) and committed with mode
   `100755`.
7. **`.ai/handoff.md` reflects the change just made** before the task is
   reported as done.
8. **No placeholder text** (`TODO`, `TBD`, `<placeholder>`, `XXX`,
   `Lorem ipsum`) inside `.ai/`. If a fact is genuinely undefined, the file
   says so in one clear sentence.
9. **`LICENSE` is present and unmodified** unless the change is licensing
   itself.
10. **No secrets, tokens, or private URLs** committed anywhere.
11. **No new contributor language** that names a single AI agent as author,
    maintainer, or owner.

## Review expectations

- Diffs touching `.ai/architecture.md` or `.ai/project.md` are
  cross-checked against the actual repo state — these files describe the
  repository and must not lie.
- Diffs touching `bin/repomemo` are reviewed alongside `tests/test_repomemo.sh`
  — new behavior gets a test.
- Diffs touching `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `templates/CLAUDE.md`, or
  `templates/AGENTS.md` land **together** when the read order or file list
  changes.
- Diffs touching `homebrew/repomemo.rb` reference a real release tag and
  SHA256 once the tag exists; placeholder SHA256 values are flagged.

## Verification

- `bash tests/test_repomemo.sh` exits 0.
- `bash bin/repomemo check .` exits 0.
- `git status` is clean before opening the PR.
